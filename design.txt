requirements:

- have hex grid as map (in progress)
- scroll map
- zoom map
- most tiles should be allowed one army, one worker.
- some tiles (or most) should allow improvements (fort, wall, city)
- interface to click on army and have it move
- multiple players
- interface to build cities, workers etc
- game mechanics to build workers, soldiers
- battle mechanics 

CLASS DESIGN:

IN GAME

GameMap: stores all tiles. This will be the central class
Tile: a hex tile in the game, will store players, structures, cities, etc
Party: abstract class for soldiers and soldiers
Structure: abstract base class for cities, forts, walls, mining camps, etc
City: sits on tile, requires food, produces workers, soldiers
Wall: sits on tile, prevents movement
Fort: sits on tile, provides defense
Camp: abstract class for camps, camps sit on resources(hills for stone, forest for wood, etc) and produce resources

A tile can hold at most: one soldier, one worker, one resource, one structure

OUT OF GAME:
UI: deals with buttons, etc (we should use a library for this, too much work and not fun)
EventManager: handles keyboard and mouse events
GameRunner: runs and handles the game
MyScreen: stores screen variables (zoom, offset), has functions to convert coordinates


POTENTIAL PROBLEMS:
too many images on screen could lower framerate

TODO:
- build test files 
- create makefile test
- install pylinter
- create installation file
